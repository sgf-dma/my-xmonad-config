Build dependencies:
1. xmobar is recompiled and installed (by stack) as part of this package.
   Thus, i have two additional (system) dependencies:
    - xpm.h (libxpm-dev on Debian, Ubuntu).
    - iwlib library (libiw-dev on Debian, Ubuntu).

Runtime dependencies:
1. `xmobar` is used as a panel.
2. `trayer` is used as a tray.
3. `feh` is used for settings desktop background (fallback to `xsetroot`, if
   not found).
4. `xterm` is used as default terminal.
5. `gmrun` is used as launcher.

Search path:
1. xmonad launch does not have any PATH requirments.
2. xmobar is first searched in stack local bin path (~/.local/bin), then in
   PATH. I.e. ~/.local/bin is hardcoded and effectively *prepended* to PATH.
   So, to use system's xmobar do not install xmobar by stack. The one way to
   do this is mark xmobar as 'extra-dep' in `stack.yaml`:

    - location: extra-pkgs/xmobar`.
      extra-dep: true
